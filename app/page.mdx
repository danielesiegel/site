<Quote />

I'm a product designer and electrical engineer at Tufts, currently working on humanoid robots in Palo Alto, CA. Previously, I designed quantum circuits at [Katmai Computing](https://www.katmaicomputing.com/) and AR headsets with [Draco Intelligence](https://www.dracointelligence.com/) and [Photon](/n/photon).

I work at the intersection of electronic/PCB design, biomedical and assistive technology, robotics, prototyping and industrial design, and emergent tech. I build with sustainability and replicability in mind, and I'm always eager to help enthusiastic engineers and founders build the 'next big thing'.

At Stanford, I contributed to the [Biomechatronics Lab's](https://biomechatronics.stanford.edu/) self-steering cane project and designed adjustable manipulator fixtures for [Dr. Mark Schnitzer's Lab](https://pyramidal.stanford.edu/). I also developed several projects with Tufts' [IdeaLAB](https://sites.tufts.edu/idea/).
