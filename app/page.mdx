<NameTransition />

Iâ€™m a product designer and electrical engineer studying at Tufts. I work at [Katmai Computing](https://www.katmaicomputing.com/) on circuit design for quantum computers. I also like [synthesizers](https://instagram.com/scenicsynths).

I'm interested in the intersection of biomedical and assistive technology, prototyping and industrial design, and emergent technologies. I believe in building equitably and sustainably.

During a gap year before Tufts, I explored these interests within maker/hacker-spaces, at the Consumer Electronics Show and other conferences, and within a startup team that I created. 

I've worked with Stanford University with the [Biomechatronics Lab](https://biomechatronics.stanford.edu/) on a self-steering for the visually impaired, and in [Dr. Mark Schnitzer's Lab](https://pyramidal.stanford.edu/) on fixtures and adjustable axial & rotational manipulators for imaging cameras. Currently, I'm involved with a number of projects within Tufts' [IdeaLAB](https://sites.tufts.edu/idea/).
