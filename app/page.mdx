*update (fall 2025) -* I've dropped out of Tufts University to work on robotics full-time. I'm currently working on reliable robot motion and perception in everyday settings at <a href="https://integralmimetics.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/images/integral-mimetics-logo.png" alt="Integral Mimetics" style={{display: 'inline', height: '1.75em', verticalAlign: 'middle', margin: '0 0.1em'}} /></a>

I'm a computer engineer and robotics researcher decentralized between Woodside, Palo Alto, and San Francisco, CA. Previously, I've worked on ML for low-power AI hardware at [FemtoAI](https://www.femto.ai), designed quantum circuits at [Katmai Computing](https://www.katmaicomputing.com/), and built humanoid robots with [Tangible](https://tangiblerobots.ai/).

I work at the intersection of electronic/PCB design, biomedical and assistive technology, robotics, prototyping and industrial design, and emergent tech. I'm focused on data acquisition for AI training, where the quality of input data directly determines model performance. I build precise collection systems to capture better training data and improve model outputs.

{/* I design systems with long-term reliability in mind, which shapes how I think about alignment. I'm curious about what makes AI actually safe versus just compliant. Most AI learns through [mimetic algorithms](https://mimetictheory.com/mimetic-ai-mimesis-and-artificial-intelligence/) (copying human behavior that may or may not be ethical) and I wonder if this imitation lacks stable foundations. I'm exploring anchored alignment: grounding systems in intrinsic principles instead of just copying behaviors that appear aligned. */}

At Stanford, I contributed to the [Biomechatronics Lab's](https://biomechatronics.stanford.edu/) self-steering cane project and designed adjustable manipulator fixtures for [Dr. Mark Schnitzer's Lab](https://schnitzerlab.stanford.edu/). I also developed several projects with Tufts' [IdeaLAB](https://sites.tufts.edu/idea/).
