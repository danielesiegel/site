# Prosthetics Design: Leg Prosthetics and Servo Arm Systems

<AnimatedName />

### Summary

I have worked on designing prototypes for prosthetic legs, incorporating concepts like inverse kinematics to improve movement and control. Additionally, I have developed servo arm systems as prosthetics, focusing on making them functional, reliable, and adaptable for users.

---

### Notes

- **Inverse Kinematics:** Applied to leg prosthetics for better movement control and mechanical element positioning.
- **Organic Design:** I have enjoyed designing prosthetics that value form as they do function, relying on spline-based CAD modeling to create organic contours and features.
- **Servo Arms:** Designed a robotic arm based on small servo motors to teach myself servo motor programming as well as metal-based fabrication techniques such as bent sheet metal fabrication.
