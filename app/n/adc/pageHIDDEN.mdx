### 24-Bit Analog-to-Digital Converter


In late 2024, I began designing a custom ADC PCB for Katmai Computing. I sourced components from Digikey and Mouser, manufactured the PCB through JLCPCB, and used a hot air rework station for assembly. The design included low-noise regulators and a compact layout for signal integrity. Each component, including a small-pin ADS131M02 ADC, was placed by hand under a circuit microscope. Debugging was performed using an oscilloscope, logic analyzer, and multimeter.

### Key Features

- **24-Bit ADC Integration**: The design incorporates the ADS131M02 ADC, providing high-resolution sampling necessary for NMR applications.
- **ESP32-S3 Core**: Utilized the ESP32-S3 for its robust processing capabilities, efficient SPI communication, and built-in wireless features.
- **Precision Voltage Regulation**: Designed a stable multi-rail power system using low-dropout regulators and a Murata DC-DC converter for Â±12V supplies.
- **Custom Signal Conditioning**: Developed differential gain and filtering stages to ensure optimal signal fidelity and minimize noise.
- **Optimized PCB Layout**: Separated analog and digital sections on the PCB to enhance performance and reduce interference.
- **Hand-Assembled Components**: Carefully placed and soldered components using a hot air rework station and microscope for accuracy.
- **Optimized PCB Layout**: Separated analog and digital sections on the PCB to enhance performance and reduce interference.
