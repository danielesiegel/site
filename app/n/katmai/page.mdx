# Katmai: Quantum Register Educational Device

<AnimatedName />

### Summary

At **Katmai**, I design and optimize **hardware and enclosures for a quantum register educational device**, built to teach **spin physics** in university labs. My work spans **precision circuit design, power electronics, EMI shielding, and iterative enclosure prototyping**. These systems help students and researchers explore **quantum mechanics, spin-state manipulation, and advanced measurement techniques**.

### Key Metrics

- **Enclosure Prototypes:** 5 distinct iterations across **sheet metal, 3D printing, and laser-cut fabrication**.  
- **ADC Precision:** 24-bit resolution with **low-noise SPI communication and op-amp-based voltage attenuation**.  
- **Power Electronics:** High-current, low-voltage distribution with **fast-switching polarization for NMR spectroscopy**.  
- **PCB Optimization:** Multi-layer design for **EMI reduction, signal integrity, and manufacturability (JLCPCB-produced).**

### Design and Process

#### **1. Enclosure Prototyping & Fabrication**
I developed **five unique enclosure prototypes**, iterating across different manufacturing techniques to balance **structural integrity, tolerancing, and cost-effectiveness**.  

- **Sheet Metal Fabrication** → Optimized bend radii, fastener integration, and manufacturability.  
- **3D Printing** → Designed for **layer adhesion, print orientation, and structural ribs** to prevent warping.  
- **Laser-Cut Assembly** → Explored **tab-and-slot construction**, fusion with other fabrication techniques, and material constraints.

#### **2. Hardware & Electronics Development**
I designed a **24-bit ADC system** with **SPI communication**, integrating an **op-amp-based voltage attenuation network** inspired by **Art of Electronics**. This required:  

- **Precision voltage reference circuits** for stable, low-drift measurements.  
- **Optimized mixed-signal PCB layout** to minimize **EMI and crosstalk** in a multi-layer design.  
- **Selection of low-noise components** to ensure high-fidelity signal acquisition.  

Beyond ADC design, my work extended into **power electronics and system-level integration**:  

- **Power distribution and EMI shielding** for low-noise operation.  
- **High-current, low-voltage regulation** to support fast-switching polarization circuits for **NMR spectroscopy**.  
- **Coil physics and back-EMF protection**, ensuring the stability of **spin-state measurements** while preventing voltage spikes.  

By iterating on **PCB design, enclosure form factor, and EMI considerations**, I’ve helped optimize **Katmai’s quantum register devices** for **scalability and lab-friendly usability**.
