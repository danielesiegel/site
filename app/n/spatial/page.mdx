# Spatial: Converting 3D Movement into Sound

<AnimatedName />

### Summary

**Spatial** is a project I'm working on through the Tufts Idea Lab, and my first software-focused project. Spatial translates **3D spatial data into sound**, converting **movement through space into an auditory experience**. The system captures **virtual nodes**—data points in the environment—and processes them into an **audio file**, effectively "sonifying" physical movement.  

Developed using **Python (backend) and Node.js, React, Next.js, Three.js (frontend)**, Spatial allows users to define a **start and end point**, process virtual node data, and **map it to pitch, volume, and effects**. Future iterations will run on an **ESP32 microcontroller** for **real-time sound processing**.
