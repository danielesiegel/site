# Surround3: User-Friendly Blind Cane

<AnimatedName />

### Summary

Surround3 is a user-friendly blind cane that offers an affordable, low-power solution for visually impaired users. Using ultrasonic sensors and an Arduino Nano microcontroller, it detects objects over one meter away and provides real-time feedback via vibrational motors. Surround3 is designed to be compatible with various canes and features a rechargeable battery for convenience and energy efficiency.

### Design and Process

I designed Surround3 with ultrasonic sensors to measure object distances and a microcontroller to process the data. The feedback system uses vibrational motors embedded in the cane's handle, providing real-time alerts to the user. The system was built around a simple, low-power architecture, using an Arduino Nano and a rechargeable battery to keep it both efficient and cost-effective. Over several iterations, I focused on optimizing the detection range and improving the energy efficiency, resulting in a solution that performs better than existing alternatives.
