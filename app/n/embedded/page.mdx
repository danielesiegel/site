# LaTeX Notes for Embedded Systems

<AnimatedName />

## Details

These LaTeX notes were taken for Professor Chang's Embedded Systems class at Tufts University during Spring 2025. They were created using my shorthand LaTeX format, "TeXpress," allowing for live note-taking at the same speed as traditional handwritten notes.

These notes are intended for personal study and should not be used to cheat. If you choose to share or distribute them, please credit me as the author.
