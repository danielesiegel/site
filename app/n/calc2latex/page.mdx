# LaTeX Notes for Calculus II

<AnimatedName />

## Details

These LaTeX notes were taken for Professor Christopher Coscia's Calculus II class at Tufts University during Fall 2024. They were created using my shorthand LaTeX format, "TeXpress," allowing for live note-taking at the same speed as traditional handwritten notes.

These notes are intended for personal study and should not be used to cheat. If you choose to share or distribute them, please credit me as the author.
